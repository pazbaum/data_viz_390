# Political Science 390: Political Data Visualizations

Welcome to my Political Science 390: Political Data Visualizations blog. Here, I will add blog posts throughout the quarter, including visualizations related to political science.

My name is Paz Baum, and I am a sophomore at Northwestern studying Political Science, Data Science, and Gender and Sexuality Studies. Through this class, I hope to learn the skills necessary to apply a data science framework to my work in political science and gender and sexuality studies.
