# Political Science 390: Political Data Visualization

Welcome to my Political Science 390: Political Data Visualizations blog. Here, I will add blog posts throughout the quarter that document my progression in the course. Blog posts will mostly be visualizations, both made by myself and by others, alongside explanations and analyses.

My name is Paz Baum, and I am a sophomore at Northwestern studying Political Science with minors in Data Science and Gender and Sexuality Studies. Through this Political Data Visualizations seminar, I hope to learn the skills necessary to apply a data science framework to my work in political science and gender and sexuality studies.

Outside of class, I enjoy reporting for WNUR News, helping to run NU's Model UN conference, and enabling students to vote through NU Votes.
