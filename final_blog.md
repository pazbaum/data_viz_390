# Final Blog: Book Bans

### Why study banned books?
For centuries, governments and schools have banned books that contradict their goals and values. In the U.S., state and federal legislators as well as individual institutions, like schools and libraries, participated in this practice at many points in history. In the 19th century, there were state bans on anti-slavery writings and federal bans on material considered “obscene” and “immoral”.[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/history-of-book-bans-in-the-united-states) This continued into the twentieth century with bans, both governmental and individual, on material condemning slavery and segregation as well as books considered pro-communist.[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/history-of-book-bans-in-the-united-states) Now in the 21st century there is heightened attention on books that include LGBTQ+ and race-related themes and people in power are removing thousands of books each year from classrooms, school libraries, and public libraries.

The most common justifications recently given for banning books were that the material in a given book “was considered to be ‘sexually explicit,’” “contained ‘offensive language,’” and/or “was ‘unsuited to any age group’”.[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/banned-books-qa) In reality, the two leading commonalities among books banned in schools are the inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters and characters of color.[<sup>4</sup>](https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/)

Book bans can be harmful because they not only restrict first amendment rights but also young people’s access to representation. Both of these are key to enabling students to form their own opinions about the world and to emotionally support students who, because of their identity, do not see themselves in traditional media.

In the 2021-22 school year, American schools banned 1,648 unique books. Bans were implemented in 32 states across 138 school districts for a total of 2,532 bans, affecting about four million students’ access to literature, representation, and knowledge.[<sup>5</sup>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTs_PB7KuTMBtNMESFEGuK-0abzhNxVv4tgpI5-iKe8/edit#gid=1397437044)

### Data Source: PEN America
PEN America is a century-old organization made up of people in the writing industry–novelists, journalists, nonfiction writers, editors, poets, essayists, playwrights, publishers, translators, agents, and readers.[<sup>6</sup>](https://pen.org/about-us/) In their mission to uphold human rights and free expression, they tracked every book ban in American schools during the 2021-22 school year. PEN America analysts reviewed news stories, district websites, and letters to school districts and spoke with librarians, authors, and teachers to compile a list of books banned in school libraries, curricula, and classrooms.[<sup>7</sup>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTs_PB7KuTMBtNMESFEGuK-0abzhNxVv4tgpI5-iKe8/edit#gid=1263265416)

One potential issue with this data is that there is no way to verify that it includes every single book ban in the country for the 2021-22 school year because each school district publicizes their ban(s) differently. Another potential issue is that some of the bans put in place may have since been revoked but the data is accurate for the bans in place during the 2021-22 school year. Despite these limitations, this dataset is trustworthy because of the comprehensive and diverse methods of data collection.
