# Short Form Blog 2: V-Dem Dataset

Cities played a vital role in enabling women to gain the right to vote in the U.S. in the early 20th century. When masses of people began moving to cities in the 19th century, Americans were in closer proximity to one another than ever before. It became easier for activist groups to communicate, meet, and organize.[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4634459?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) I was curious if, like the American women’s suffrage movement, urbanization was correlated with expanded suffrage in different parts of the world at different times in history. I evaluate the relationship between the urbanization of countries and the percentage of adults with the right to vote in those countries using data from the V-Dem dataset.

### Urbanization

V-Dem calculates urbanization as the ratio of the urban population of a country to the general population of that country. As shown in the plot above, the ratio of people in urban areas to the general population increased fairly consistently around the world from 1800 to 2000. This is an accurate measure of the rate at which a country urbanizes, although there are other metrics of urbanization. Another way to measure urbanization is the percentage of a country’s population living in urban areas.[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/urbanisation/5-ways-for-measuring-urbanisation-explained/9996)

### Suffrage
![A line plot titled "Suffrage Worldwide 1800 - 2000" with "Year" on the x-axis from 1800 to 2000 and "% of People with Suffrage" on the y-axis, showing that urbanization increased worldwide from the year 1800 to 2000.](https://github.com/pazbaum/data_viz_390/blob/main/vdem_suff_distribution.png)
V-Dem calculates suffrage as the percentage of a country’s adult population with the legal right to vote in national elections. This metric only includes de jure, not de facto, access to voting. Some variables that lower countries’ V-Dem suffrage rating are laws that limit people’s right to vote based on gender, race, property, and religion. Suffrage could be more accurately measured by including the effects of de facto factors on people’s access to voting, such as limiting the hours during which polling locations are open. As shown in the plot above, the share of the adult population with the right to vote worldwide has increased greatly since 1800.

### Relationship Between Urbanization and Suffrage
![A scatter plot titled "Urbanization and Suffrage Worldwide 1800 - 2000" with "Urbanization" on the x-axis and "% of People with Suffrage" on the y-axis.](https://github.com/pazbaum/data_viz_390/blob/main/vdem_dotplot.png)
As demonstrated in the plot above, as urbanization increases, suffrage also increases. This is consistent with the fact that urban areas are conducive to activist groups organizing and advocating for the rights such as the right to vote. Additionally, cities tend to be more liberal than non-urban areas and liberal governments tend to expand suffrage. Therefore, as more residents of a country move to cities, that country is likely to become more liberal and give more people the right to vote.[<sup>3</sup>](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cities-conference/home)

![A tile plot titled "Suffrage and Urbanization Worldwide" with "% of People with Suffrage" on the x-axis and "Urbanization" on the y-axis.](https://github.com/pazbaum/data_viz_390/blob/main/vdem_tile.png)
The tile plot, like the scatterplot, shows that the majority of countries that have a high rate of urbanization also have high suffrage. For example, the biggest share of countries in the V-Dem dataset have a medium rate of urbanization, between 0.2 and 0.4, and a high percentage of adults with suffrage, between 66% and 100%. One possible confounding variable is time, though, since countries tend to both build more cities and expand suffrage as time goes on. Another variable worth looking into is region since social, political, and economic conditions, all of which affect urbanization and suffrage, vary greatly across geopolitical regions.

![A bar plot titled "Urbanization and Suffrage by Region" with "Region" on the x-axis and "% of People with Suffrage" on the y-axis. The bars are colored so that the darkest bars represent regions with a high rate of urbanization and the lightest bars represent regions with a low rate of urbanization.](https://github.com/pazbaum/data_viz_390/blob/main/vdem_barplot.png)
This plot shows that there is in fact region-based variation in both urbanization and suffrage. One curious point is that the region with the lowest urbanization rate–Southern Asia–and the region with the highest urbanization rate–Eastern Asia–both have high suffrage. This may be because all countries expanded voting rights over the past few centuries while only some urbanized greatly.

![A plot of ten line graphs titled "Urbanization and Suffrage Worldwide". Each plot represents a region and has "Year" on the x-axis and "% of People with Suffrage" on the y-axis. The lines on each plot are colored so that darker parts of the each line represent a time of high urbanization and lighter parts of each line represent a time of low urbanization.](https://github.com/pazbaum/data_viz_390/blob/main/vdem_line_graph.png)
Urbanization and suffrage both increased from 1800 to 2000 in almost all geopolitical regions. It is therefore possible that time is a confounding variable. It is also possible, though, that either urbanization caused suffrage to expand and/or expanded suffrage caused urbanization in these regions in the 19th and 20th centuries. More research is needed to determine if the relationship between urbanization and suffrage in the 19th and 20th centuries was causal.
