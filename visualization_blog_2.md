# Visualization Blog 2: Improving Two Visualizations

## Visualization 1

**Remake**

The main change I made in my plot remake is demonstrating that hazardous work is a subset of child labor, not a separate phenomenon that affects a different population of children. One issue that I was unable to address is the exclusion of data for child labor in North America.

**Original Plot**

**Remake**

The main change I made in my plot remake is creating a histogram instead of a line graph which makes the linear process of time passing more clear. I kept gas prices on the y-axis and moved approval rating from the x-axis to the fill color of the histogram bins. This is because it is more helpful to know the specific month at a given point (therefore time is on the x-axis) and generally if Biden's approval is good or bad rather than to know the specific approval rating (originally on the x-axis) and not know the month of the data point.
