# Visualization Blog 3: Final Project Proposal

**Research Question** <br>
How does increasing the number of women in public office affect maternal mortality?

**Data** <br>
Data: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=6696214&version=1.0 <br>
This data will be useful because it includes variables such as the percentage of members of parliament who are women in each country and the maternal mortality rate in each country. It includes other interesting variables that may affect the relationship like the teen pregnancy rate that could be included in some visualizations. There is both categorical data, like country names, and continuous data, like maternal mortality rates.

**Relationships to Explore** <br>
I especially want to look into how the relationship between female political power and maternal mortality rate differs between countries that have a diverse set of political and social histories. Particularly, I am interested to know if countries that have a more conservative history--for example, are generally more opposed to teen pregnancy--still lower the maternal mortality rate when more women enter into public office as one would expect.

I also want to explore how race and socioeconomic status affect female political power and maternal mortality rate. In the U.S., there is a huge disparity in maternal health outcomes between Black people and white people. I am curious to know if these disparities are improved at all in the U.S. and other countries when more women are elected.

**Inspiring Visualizations**

I would like to create a visualization similar to the one above in which countries are filled in based on how their maternal mortality rate changed over a given period of time (increased, decreased, or stayed the same) as more women entered into public office. I will include a key that conveys more information than the key in the plot above.

The plot above inspires me to create a similar horizontal bar plot. I would like to create a plot that orders, from top to bottom, countries based on what percentage of their parliament is women, and then displays their maternal mortality rate as bars. This, like the plot above, will be a clear representation of which countries have concerning maternal mortality rates and how that correlates to women's political power.
